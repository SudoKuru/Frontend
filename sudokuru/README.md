# How to start the app

Run ```npm i```
Run ```npm run start```

For testing with a mobile device you can download the Expo app.<br>
You will also need to be logged in to Expo on the development device (laptop/desktop that is running the code)<br>
Contact Thomas to get added to the Expo organization so you can log in with your own email and password.<br>
For iOS, scan the QR code with your camera app, for Android you will need to scan the code from within the Expo app.<br>
For Web, hit the w key to start up the website at ```localhost:19006```

## This Project uses React-Native-Web. This means we will share code for the app and the website and avoid duplicating our work.
